# NLP Analysis Project

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyses and techniques implemented in Python. The project demonstrates various NLP concepts from basic text processing to advanced machine learning applications for text classification.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main sections, each focusing on different aspects of NLP, plus a final project that applies these concepts:

1. **Exploration** - Basic text processing and analysis
2. **Text Tagging** - Named Entity Recognition and POS tagging
3. **Sentiment Analysis** - Analyzing sentiment in text data
4. **Fake News Classification** - A complete project applying NLP techniques to classify news articles

## Sections Overview

### 1. Exploration (`1-Exploration/`)

This section demonstrates fundamental NLP techniques using TripAdvisor hotel reviews:

- Text preprocessing (lowercase conversion, punctuation removal)
- Tokenization
- Stop word removal
- Regular expressions for pattern matching
- Basic text cleaning and normalization

### 2. Text Tagging (`2-Text_tagging/`)

This section explores more advanced NLP techniques using BBC news articles:

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Entity extraction and analysis
- Text categorization

### 3. Sentiment Analysis (`3-Sentiment_analysis/`)

This section focuses on sentiment analysis techniques using book reviews:

- VADER sentiment analysis
- Text classification by sentiment
- Sentiment scoring and interpretation

### 4. Fake News Classification (`Fake_news_classification/`)

Project applying multiple NLP techniques to classify news articles as fake or factual:

- Advanced text preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Machine learning models for text classification
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## General Review

The `Review.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive overview of various NLP techniques used throughout the project:

- Stop word removal
- Regular expressions
- Tokenization
- Stemming and lemmatization
- Text normalization
